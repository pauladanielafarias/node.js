# 1. Installing Node.js

1. Download Node.js at https://nodejs.org/

2. Check the version of node you have installed:

```$ node -v```


# 2. Using Node.js modules

They come installed by default when Node.js is installed.

To use the modules, first you have to enable them. Write on the first lines of your code:

```const alias = require('moduleName')```

For example, for the File System module you should write:

```const fs = require('fs');```

_See the documentation at https://nodejs.org/api/_
